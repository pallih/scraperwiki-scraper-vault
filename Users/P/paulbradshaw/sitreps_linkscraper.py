#This grabs all links to Excel spreadsheet from one page, then scrapes each one
#To test without taking too much time, the ranges are limited to a few spreadsheets, a few sheets, and a few rows

#Key points to remember: there needs to be two unique keys for each record: the SHA amd the URL
#Also, keys with slashes - / - need to be cleaned with .replace before being used

#REMEMBER TO CHANGE LINES FOR RANGES OF SHEETS, ROWS, AND LINKS TO GET FULL DATA
